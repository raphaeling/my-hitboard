[myhitboard](myhitboard.vercel.app) is a work-in-progress web application that gives you your own weekly top 10 last.fm and Spotify streams with chart updates!

### Future/to-do features
 - A logo ðŸ™Š
 - "Empty history" UI if no charts are saved
 - Compare charts with past charts (No button for the last chart!)
 - Separate Spotify and lastfm charts, to make it clear that they track different time ranges (Spotify 1 month; last.fm 1 week)
    - Perhaps, just grab 1 month's worth for consistency. I'll keep brainstorming potential use cases!
 - Delete individual charts rather than clearing the whole storage
 - Cloud storage of charts (with login)


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
